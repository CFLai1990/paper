\col{Outline for discussion:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Extension: other featured projections, non-linear projections
\item Impact of data scale: increased dimensionality or data size, try a larger dataset with higher dimensionality
\item Comparison: local-preserving algorithms, projections for classification
\item Problems: lack of navigation, overlapping dimensions in a projection
\end{enumerate}
