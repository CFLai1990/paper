%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Dimension reduced projection accommodates all data in a low-dimensional space to approximate the high-dimensional distribution. It makes a good overview, but can hardly meet the needs of local data analyses. On the one hand, layout distortions largely harm the perception of local data relationships, especially in linear projections. On the other hand, non-linear projections seek to preserve local neighborhoods (e.g. Isomap, t-SNE) but at the expense of losing dimensional contexts. In fact, a sole projection can't be enough for local analyses with varying targets. It will be better to alter the layout according to users' point of interest (POI) and analytic tasks. In this paper, we extend such an idea into an interactive exploration scheme, to help users customize a linear projection for better local data analyses. Specifically, we first allow users to define their POI data. Then regarding different analytic tasks, we recommend projections and subspaces where different features of the POI are enhanced. Moreover, we provide various means to help users discover, analyze, modify and compare multiple POIs. At last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via case studies with real-world datasets.

  \caption{We propose an interactive and exploratory scheme for local analysis in high-dimensional data. (a) We first present a global projection as the overview. (b) Then suggestions are made to help user find an interesting piece of local data. (c) User chooses some local data as the focus, and named a feature to be analyzed. (d) We make linear projections to enhance local features of the chosen data. Different features are defined for different analytic tasks. (e) A feature-related subspace is also revealed to support dimensional analysis. From the resulting projection and subspace, users can gain both structural and dimensional insights about the data focus. (f) Finally, the user can move on to a new focus, and store valuable findings in Focus List for further study. Projection Map is provided to help compare multiple focuses in the list based on their features.
