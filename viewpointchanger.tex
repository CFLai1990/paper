%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1
%% typefaces, ``graphicx'' for inclusion of EPS figures. and ``times''
%% for proper handling of the times font family.

%% We encourage the use of mathptmx for consistent usage of times font

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Dimension reduced projection usually accommodates all data to approximate the original data distribution. It makes a good overview, but it cannot meet the needs of local data analyses. On one hand, projection distortions largely harm the perception of local relationships. On the other hand, a sole projection cannot satisfy local analyses with various targets. To address this problem, we propose an interactive exploration method, to help users customize linear projections for a better local analysis. Specifically, we allow users to define their point of interest (POI) data. Then regarding different analytic purposes, we alter the projection to enhance different features of the POI. Furthermore, we provide means to help users discover, analyze, modify and compare multiple POIs. At last, our method is proved effective via case studies with real-world datasets.
