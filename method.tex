\section{High-dimensional Data Exploration Guided by Distortion-Free Local Analysis}
As previously mentioned, the proposed method supports a four-step exploration. In this section, we'll elaborate details of our method in each step of the exploration process.
\label{section:method}
\subsection{Discovering Interesting Local Focus}
Following Shneiderman's suggestion~\cite{DBLP:conf/vl/Shneiderman96}, we first provide the PCA projection as an overview of the data. Then we help the user find an interesting subset as the focus of subsequent local analysis. In a projection, there are two situations where some local data is considered interesting. First, the data is involved in some featured relationships, like being an outlier or a cluster. The relationship may have been distorted, but it's still the dominant relationships in the current projection. Second,
