\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an interactive method, that helps customize a linear projection to facilitate the analysis of user-defined local data. We also provide various kinds of techniques to support a fluent high-dimensional data exploration. Users are assisted to discover, analyze, modify and compare multiple pieces of local data.
