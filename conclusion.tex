\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an interactive method, that helps customize a linear projection to facilitate the analysis of user-defined local data. By incorporating users' POI with dimension reduced projection, we make more efficient use of the display space, and more effectively meets users' analytic needs. We also provide various kinds of techniques to support a fluent high-dimensional data exploration. Users are assisted to discover, analyze, modify and compare multiple pieces of local data. At present, our method only provides several kinds of local improvements, including local distortion reduction and local relationship enhancements. However, our method is totally compatible with more complex enhancements. It's also applicable to more general kinds of projections. The integration of user-defined focuses will largely benefit dimension reduction techniques. We look forward to extending our method to a broader field in the future.
