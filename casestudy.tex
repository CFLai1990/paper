\section{Case Study}
In this section, we demonstrate the effective of our method with two real-world datasets.

\subsection{USDA Food Data}
The first case comes from the USDA Food Composition Data Set (http://www.ars.usda.gov/).  The dataset describes nutrients of a collection of raw or processed foods. It has been used in some previous works~\cite{DBLP:conf/ieeevast/TatuMFBSSK12}~\cite{DBLP:journals/tvcg/YuanRWG13} for their case studies. After preprocessing, the dataset contains 722 records and 18 dimensions.
